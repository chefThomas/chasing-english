    '"I have been wanting to write this for awhile now, but just could not find the right words to express the heartfelt appreciation and respect I have for who Kendra is and all that she does. She is an inspiration, and I am deeply grateful that she was a part of our son’s middle school years when he was first finding his written voice."',

    "Thank you so much for such a positive writing experience for our son. He was engaged in the story and activities long after the online sessions ended, enjoyed the book, and interacting with the group. He also enjoyed the Google platform of viewing the video during front loading activities and of posting comments then conversing with online video. As a parent, I think what a great opportunity to utilize online skills in a fun, academic interaction. Kendra, you've synthesized technology and learning so beautifully.",

    'Thank you so much for your interest and passion you have provided over the past couple of years.

    "Kendra's profound knowledge of writing can only be surpassed by her warm, caring, and joyful teaching methods. She is an inspiring teacher who brings out the creativity and inner writer in each of her students. If it weren't for Kendra my daughter would not have learned the craft of writing.",

Not only are her lessons interesting, engaging, and informative, but she truly cares about each of her students, both academically and personally, and makes that very clear to everyone.  The writing I completed during my time with her is some of the most meaningful I have ever done.',

    'Kendra encouraged the fire within me to learn how to write. Kendra was always there for me to encourage, teach, and help me with every single assignment we ever had. By the time I left her class at the end of my middle school writing journey I felt confident in myself that she had given me all the tools I needed to be successful in high school.',

    'Kendra is a great teacher-- period. It is also obvious - and can be seen on a daily basis when she is with her students - how much Kendra loves literature and writing – it is contagious. Her standards are always high and she expects students to do their best work. This combination of respect from students and their desire to do well, in my experience, is the quality that only the best teachers have. Students know that she has their back and that she expects them to bring their “A” game when they attend her class.',
