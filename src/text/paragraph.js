Prior to her time teaching seventh and eighth graders in Seattle, Kendra worked as a resident writer at an International Baccalaureate school where she also taught the Language and Literature component of the program to middle school students and worked with seniors on their college admission essays. Preceding that experience, she taught Language Arts at a school for the gifted and spent time as an editor for an annually published literary journal during her graduate studies.',

    '"I have been wanting to write this for awhile nownd just could not find the right words to express the heartfelt appreciation and respect I have for who Kendra is and all that she does. She is an inspiration, and I am deeply grateful that she was a part of our son’s middle school years when he was first finding his written voice."',

  am:
    "Thank you so much for such a positive writing experience for our son. He was engaged in the story and activities long after the online sessions ended, enjoyed the book, and interacting with the group. He also enjoyed the Google platform of viewing the video during front loading activities and of posting comments then conversing with online video. As a parent, I think what a great opportunity to utilize online skills in a fun, academic interaction. Kendra, you've synthesized technology and learning so beautifully.",

  kr:
    'Thank you so much for your interest and passion you have provided over the past couple of years. Our daughter has absolutely loved having you as a teacher and you have left a mark on her of positive impact. You are not only inspiring, but demonstrate the passion you have for your craft and your students as well.',

    "Kendra's profound knowledge of writing can only be surpassed by her warm, caring, and joyful teaching methods. She is an inspiring teacher who brings out the creativity and inner writer in each of her students. If it weren't for Kendra my daughter would not have learned the craft of writing.",

    'Kendra has made an unquantifiable impact on my life. More than just a teacher, she has always been a supportive and caring mentor to me. To put it simply, Kendra is an incredible teacher. Not only are her lessons interesting, engaging, and informative, but she truly cares about each of her students, both academically and personally, and makes that very clear to everyone.  The writing I completed during my time with her is some of the most meaningful I have ever done.',

    'I always liked to write, but I never really had an extremely passionate and inspirational English teacher that gave me a desire to write and express myself in that way outside of the classroom.  You have instilled in me a passion to write creatively and I feel so comfortable in your class (and outside of it) doing so.  I will continue to take your classes as long as you teach them! Thank you, Kendra :)',

    'Kendra is a great teacher-- period. It is also obvious - and can be seen on a daily basis when she is with her students - how much Kendra loves literature and writing – it is contagious. Her standards are always high and she expects students to do their best work. This combination of respect from students and their desire to do well, in my experience, is the quality that only the best teachers have. Students know that she has their back and that she expects them to bring their “A” game when they attend her class.',
  jw:
    'Kendra is an extremely capable educator who has created an environment where students are challenged academically, yet feel safe, supported, and appropriately acknowledged when they succeed.  Her teaching style is creative, engaging, and student centered.  However, what is most impressive about Kendra is her ability to forge strong relationships with her students.',

    'Interested in gaining support but don’t have the time to commit to an individual coaching schedule or group programs? If so, single-day workshops may be of interest.
